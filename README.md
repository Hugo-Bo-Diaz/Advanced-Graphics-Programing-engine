# Advanced Graphics Programing engine
In this repository you will find an engine made for the subject of Advanced graphics programing with Jesus diaz as our teacher.

This engine was developed from the base engine provided for the subject by me in order to be able to apply some of the techniques that were explained in class. Some of these techniques are:

* Deferred shading:

images

show combo box + other lighting options

map_calculation.glsl
deferred.glsl

* Water effects:

image

show combo box

water_render.glsl
water_plane.glsl

* Normal maps:

comparison on/off

show bumpiness dragfloat

forward_shading.glsl
map_calculation.glsl

* Height/bump maps:

comparison on/off

show bumpiness dragfloat

forward_shading.glsl
map_calculation.glsl
